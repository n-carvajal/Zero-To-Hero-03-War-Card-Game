## Project 3: War Card Game

War is a simple single deck, two player card game where the goal of the game is to be the first player to win all 52 cards in the deck.

### Rules

The deck is shuffled and divided evenly between the two players with cards dealt one at a time face down.
Once all cards dealt, each player places their stack of cards face-down, in front of them.
Each player then turns up a card and the player whose card has the highest score wins the round.
The winning player takes both the upturned cards and places them face down at the bottom of their stack.

If when the players turn up their cards, they are of the same rank, it is **war**.

If a war occurs, each player must play out 3 cards face down into a war pile and one card face up in front of them.
The player with the highest score on their upturned card wins the war and takes both the war card pile and the upturned cards.
The collected cards are then added face down to the bottom of the winning player's stack.
If however, the upturned cards are equal, war is declared again.
Each player adds another 3 cards face down to the war pile and plays another card face up.
This continues until one player produces a higher value card and takes all the cards in the war pile and any upturned cards.

The game ends when one player has won all the cards in the deck.
